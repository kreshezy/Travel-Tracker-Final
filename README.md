# Travel-Tracker-Final

'''At the beginning of this course, I thought this course is similar with Programming I. Therefore, I did not
     put too much energy on this course. After two or three weeks, I found this course is not as easy as I consider,
     and I learned this course becoming more and more difficult. I am a person who truly receive the new knowledge slowly,
     so I started to spend much more time on this course, not only to learned what professor teach us during the lecture,
     but also learned more functions, concepts and new ways of coding out of the class by using internet and Github,
     such as dataframe, shape, drop, header, and lambda. I used all these in my assignment 1, but I got failed due to
     some serious mistakes. After receiving the result of assignment 1, I realized that exactly follow the instructions
     of assignment is the most important. However, I ignored the instructions because I wanted to show my codes to lecturer
     I learned new stuff outside the class. Then I started my reflection after I see my result of assignment 1. I spent more
     time and energy on my assignment 2 than assignment 1 because I really wanted to obtain an satisfied marks for the second
     assignment. During the process of doing assignment 2, there are several challenges for me in main.py and app.kv files,
     such as combine add new place and button pressed. Fortunately, the previous practical questions and the sources in assignment 2
     were provided to students. After learning the logic and codes of these sources and internet sources, I overcame the
     errors and challenges. Finally, the most significant improvement of my assignment 2 is I followed the instruction carefully
     instead of just showing new codes to lecturer, and corrected and simplified few codes that I had done in assignment 1.
     Overall, assignment 2 is valuable and challengeable project for me. '''
